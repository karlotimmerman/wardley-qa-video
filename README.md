YouTube Video Query AI Model
This is a Python script that scrapes the transcription from a YouTube video and builds a vector database for querying via OpenAI. The script makes use of several key libraries and modules, including openai, streamlit, llama_index, and gpt_index.

Getting Started
To use this script, you'll need to install the necessary libraries and modules:

bash
Copy code
pip install openai llama_index streamlit gpt_index
You'll also need an OpenAI API key, which you can get by signing up for an account at OpenAI.

Usage
To run the script, simply run the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will start the Streamlit web interface, which you can use to enter prompts and generate AI-generated responses based on the content of a YouTube video.

Configuration
Before running the script, you'll need to set up your OpenAI API key. You can do this by creating a .env file in the root directory of the project, and adding the following line:

makefile
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
You'll also need to specify the YouTube video you want to use as the source for the transcript. This can be done by editing the ytlinks parameter in the following line of code in app.py:

python
Copy code
documents = loader.load_data(ytlinks=['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkePAhnkHeg'])
Potential Improvements
One potential improvement to the code could be to include more advanced query expansion techniques, such as using synonyms or related terms to expand the user's query and find more relevant responses. Another improvement could be to incorporate user feedback to improve the relevance of the AI-generated responses over time.
